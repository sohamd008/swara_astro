Pandit Ram Marathe (1924–1989) was a multi-faceted genius of Indian Classical Music. He was unique in his ability to master the distinct styles of three major Gharanas: Agra, Gwalior, and Jaipur-Atrauli. This versatility allowed him to perform Khayal with immense depth, while also being a legendary figure in Marathi Sangeet Natak (Musical Theatre).

His legacy is preserved through his numerous students and these rare recordings, which capture the spiritual and technical brilliance of his 'Gayaki'. This treasury includes some of his most celebrated Raga renditions and soulful devotional pieces.
