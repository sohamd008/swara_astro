Ustad Abdul Karim Khan (1872–1937) was one of the most influential figures in Indian Classical Music and the founder of the Kirana Gharana. His music was defined by its profound emotionality, a quality often described as 'pukar' (a call from the soul), which deeply moved listeners.

He revolutionized the Khayal style by introducing the slow, meditative progression of the raga (vilambit laya) and emphasizing the purity of notes (swara). His innovations extended to Thumri as well, where he infused a unique lyrical beauty that set a new benchmark for the genre. He was also an accomplished player of the Sarangi and Veena, which greatly influenced his vocal style, particularly in the continuity and fluidity of his phrasing.

Ustad Abdul Karim Khan's legacy lives on through his vast discography and the generations of musicians he inspired, including Pt. Sawai Gandharva, Pt. Bhimsen Joshi, and Dr. Gangubai Hangal. His recordings remain a treasure trove for students and connoisseurs alike.
